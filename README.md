The Smart Blind Stick is an innovative assistive device designed to enhance the mobility, safety, and independence of visually impaired individuals. By integrating IoT technologies and multiple sensors, this project offers a modern upgrade to the traditional white cane.

# Project Overview
This smart stick uses a combination of sensors and connectivity modules to detect obstacles, water, and stairs, while also providing real-time voice feedback and fall detection alerts. The goal is to provide a cost-effective, user-friendly, and portable tool that increases awareness and reduces risk during navigation.

# Features
Obstacle Detection – Ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles in the user's path.
Water Detection – Wet sensor alerts the user about wet surfaces or puddles.
Stair Detection – IR sensor helps in identifying stairs or sudden height changes.
Fall Detection – Accelerometer triggers an automatic SMS alert to emergency contacts in case of a fall.
Real-Time Voice Feedback – Bluetooth voice commands guide the user for a safer experience.

# Technologies Used
Ultrasonic Sensor – For proximity sensing.
IR Sensor – For staircase detection.
Wet Sensor – For water detection.
Accelerometer (MPU6050) – For fall detection.
Bluetooth Module – For voice feedback and device communication.
GSM Module (SIM800L) – For sending SMS alerts.
Microcontroller ( Arduino) – For processing and integration

# Future Enhancements
 AI-based object recognition for better environmental understanding.
 GPS integration for advanced navigation and location tracking.
 Mobile app integration for configuration and monitoring.

# How It Works
1. Sensors continuously monitor the surroundings.
2. If an obstacle, water, or stair is detected, a voice alert is sent to the user.
3. In case of a fall, an emergency SMS with location info is sent to saved contacts.

# Impact
This project demonstrates how IoT and sensor technology can be harnessed to significantly improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals, making everyday navigation safer and more informed.
